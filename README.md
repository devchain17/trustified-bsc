**Trustified is a platform to issue forgery proof digital certificates and badges on Blockchain.**

# Why Trustified?

**Trustified provides**:

Availability: All the data will be stored on decentralised storage of the Filecoin network.

Forgery Proof: Each certificate and badge will be an NFT on the FVM blockchain.

Ownership: Ensures true ownership of digital badges and certificates.
